      "\n",
      "1. **Incident 0:** The `javax.ejb` package is part of the Java EE specification, while `jakarta.ejb` is the equivalent package in Jakarta EE (the successor of Java EE). Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, so we need to replace the import statement accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incident 1:** Similar to incident 0, we need to replace the `javax.inject` package with `jakarta.inject` as Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incident 2:** Stateful EJBs are not natively supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use CDI beans with a suitable scope. Here, we choose `@SessionScoped` because stateful EJBs often translate to session-scoped beans. However, the appropriate scope may vary depending on the application's architecture. Note that it is recommended to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.\n",
