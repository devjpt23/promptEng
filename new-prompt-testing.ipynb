      "1. In this example, the `@Stateful` annotation is replaced with `@Named(\"shoppingCartService\")` and `@Stateful`. This is because Quarkus does not support `@Stateful` EJBs directly. Instead, you can use a CDI bean with the appropriate scope. In this case, the bean is named \"shoppingCartService\" and has the `@Stateful` annotation for compatibility with the existing code. However, it is recommended to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.\n",
      "2. The `EntityManager` is injected using `@PersistenceContext` for managing the persistence context.\n",
      "3. The `@Remove` annotation is added to the `remove()` method to allow for removing the stateful bean.\n",
      "4. The `quarkus-narayana-jta` extension should be added to the `pom.xml` file to enable JTA transactions.\n",
      "5. The `quarkus-jpa` extension should be added to the `pom.xml` file to enable JPA.\n",
      "6. The `quarkus-undertow` extension should be added if `@SessionScoped` is used.\n",
      "7. The `quarkus-arc` extension should be added for CDI support.\n",
      "8. The `quarkus-hibernate-orm` extension should be added for Hibernate ORM support.\n",
      "9. The `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension should be added for bean validation support.\n",
      "10. The `quarkus-agroal` extension should be added for a connection pool.\n",
