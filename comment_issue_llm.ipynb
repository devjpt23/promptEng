    "1. We need to update the import statements from `javax` to `jakarta` packages. This is because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE, which is the new name for Java EE, and uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `@Stateful` annotation needs to be replaced. In this case, since the `ShoppingCartService` seems to maintain state for each user (as evidenced by the comment \"Each user can have multiple shopping carts\"), we should use `@SessionScoped`. However, this requires activating the `quarkus-undertow` extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies. We'll need to add the `quarkus-undertow` extension for `@SessionScoped` to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method uses JNDI lookup, which is not typically used in Quarkus. However, since we're taking one step at a time, we'll leave this method as is for now. In a future step, we'd likely refactor this to use CDI injection or another Quarkus-friendly approach.\n",

      "1. **incident 0**: The `javax.ejb` package is part of the Java EE specification, while Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n",

      "3. **incident 2**: Stateful EJBs are not natively supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use CDI beans with a suitable scope. In this case, we can replace the `@Stateful` annotation with `@SessionScoped` as stateful EJBs often translate to session-scoped beans. However, it is recommended to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.\n",
