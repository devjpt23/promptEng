    " Due to this change, users that previously used `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationStrategy.AUTO)` or simply `@GeneratedValue` (since `AUTO` is the default), need to ensure that the database now contains sequences for every entity, named `<entity name>_seq`. For an entity Person, a sequence person_seq is expected to exist. \n",

      "After updating the imports and annotations, you need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any Java EE dependencies and add Quarkus-specific dependencies if not already present. In this case, you might need to remove the `jboss-ejb-api` and `javax.inject` dependencies and add the `quarkus-arc` dependency for CDI support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you might need to update the `META-INF/beans.xml` file to configure CDI if it is not automatically generated by Quarkus. However, since Quarkus uses a different approach for dependency injection, you might not need this file at all.\n",

      "Lastly, you might need to update the `application.properties` file to configure the application accordingly. For instance, if you are using a database, you need to add the appropriate configuration.\n"
