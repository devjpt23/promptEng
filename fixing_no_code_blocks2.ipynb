      "\n",
      "In the `pom.xml`, you may need to update the dependencies to use the Jakarta EE API instead of the Java EE API. For example, replace `javax.ejb-api` with `jakarta.ejb-api`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you may need to remove the `jboss-ejb-api_3.2_spec` dependency, as it is part of the Java EE API.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that you might need to make further changes to the code, such as removing the `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method and injecting the `ShippingServiceRemote` directly, depending on your application architecture.\n",
      "## Reasoning\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incident 0**: The `javax.ejb` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` to update the codebase according to the Jakarta EE 9 specification, which Quarkus follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incident 1**: The `javax.inject` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for the same reason as Incident 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incident 2**: The `@Stateful` annotation should be replaced with a bean-defining annotation that encompasses the appropriate scope. In this case, we will use `@ApplicationScoped` since it is a common choice for EJBs converted to CDI beans. However, the appropriate scope may differ based on the application architecture. Keep in mind that it is recommended to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.\n",
