      "The `javax.inject` package is from Java EE and needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for Quarkus. This is a simple import statement change.\n",

      "Java EE/Jakarta EE JMS elements need to be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This involves removing the existing imports and annotations related to JMS and adding the appropriate Quarkus dependencies and annotations.\n",

      "However, we will not be able to fully replace the JMS code in this step, as Quarkus uses a reactive approach for message handling. We will need to adapt the code to use SmallRye's `Message` class instead of `javax.jms.Message`.\n",
